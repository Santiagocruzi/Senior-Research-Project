## A Comparative Study of Effectiveness Between Classical Classification Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks
Malware is becoming a significant issue in today's climate. 

The objective of this project is to conduct a comparative study into how accurately classical classification machine learning techniques and neural networks can predict whether a machine will be the victim of an attack according to its characteristics. This will aid future research into leveraging machine learning in the prevention and detection of future, more complex, malware. Anti-malware programs may also find this research valuable, as they could implement similar algorithms to counteract malware threats. 


### Getting Started 
Either clone the repo or download the Juypter Notebook from Github browser.

You will need Juypter Notebook to run the following python notebook. Here is a link to install: https://jupyter.org/

You will need to download the dataset from the following link, as Github does not allow files over 25 MB to be uploaded onto the repo. 

Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data

Open Juypter Notebook, and once you have the train.csv and the MalwarePrediction.ipynb in the same directory, run each cell in Juypter.

The following outputs are our results.
