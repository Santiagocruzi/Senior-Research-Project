## A Comparative Study of Effectiveness Between Classical Classification Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks
Malware is becoming a significant issue in today's climate. 

The objective of this project is to conduct a comparative study into how accurately classical classification machine learning techniques and neural networks can predict whether a machine will be the victim of an attack according to its characteristics. This will aid future research into leveraging machine learning in the prevention and detection of future, more complex, malware. Anti-malware programs may also find this research valuable, as they could implement similar algorithms to counteract malware threats.
